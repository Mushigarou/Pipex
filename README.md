# Pipex
## Usage
Pipex is a program that handles pipes and redirections in Unix / Linux systems.

For the mandatory part :
```
 make
 ./pipex infile cmd_1 cmd_2 outfile
 ```
 
For the bonus part :
```
 make
 ./pipex infile cmd_1 ... cmd_n outfile
 ```
 
The program supports heredocument too, here is the syntax that should be given to the program :
```
 ./pipex here_doc DELIMITER cmd_1 ... cmd_n outfile
 ```
 
In the mandatoy part, I've created one pipe (pipe(2)) to communicate between the two child processes. Then, i forked (fork(2)) twice in the parent process, and i wait for the child processes before returning zero upon successful completion.

Making a command write its output in the pipe, instead of STDOUT_FILENO, is done by using the dup2(2) function.

## Bonus
For the bonus part, we have to handle multiple pipes, and `«` and `»` when the first parameter is "here_doc".

### This command:
```
 ./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 ... cmdn file2
 ```
 
Should behave like :
```
 < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3 ... | cmdn > file2
 ```
### And this :

```
 ./pipex here_doc LIMITER cmd cmd1 file
 ```
Should behave like
```
$> cmd << LIMITER | cmd1 >> file
```
